# KPM
Using Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM) to compute the density of state (DOS) of some structures.

Different electronic properties of a structure can be written in terms of Green's functions.
If the structure is enough big to be considered infinite, the Green's functions can be expanded
in terms of an orthogonal basis such as Chebyshev polynomial. Here the KPM technique is 
implemented for fast computation of Green's function and features line DOS. The Hamiltonian
is written using the tight-binding approximation.
